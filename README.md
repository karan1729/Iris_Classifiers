**Features**

Features: SepalLengthCm , SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm

**Target** **Variable**

Target: Species

Outcome

We basically used 3 types of classifiers to predict the outcome of the IRIS types.

kNN The accuracy score turned out to be 1 . This might be due to the less number of data in the datasets since in the real life situations the datasets we deal with has data over 100000 entries.
